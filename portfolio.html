						<em>"Infra-Sight"</em> is a program that myself and <a href="https://eli-wood-dev.github.io">Eli Wood</a>
						built
						for our school's Overwatch e-sport team. Written in Node.js, it pulls relevant player stats from each player
						on the team,
						and displays them all in one place. This is useful to determine which players we should put in the match
						based on their
						skill on each role.

						I'm on First Robotics Competition team <a href="https://www.thebluealliance.com/team/7509">7509</a>,
						<em>"Brainstorm Robotics"</em>. Check out our robot from 2023
						in the video! <br><br>
						More recently, our team has installed a swerve drive base on our robot for the first time. While it was
						quite difficult to understand at first, we were able to get a grasp of how the subsystem worked in time for
						competition.
						The ability to drive omnidirectionally proved useful in our 2024 McMaster competition, where we were allied
						with
						teams <a href="https://2056.ca/">2056</a> and <a href="https://mmrambotics.com/">2200</a> who proposed the
						idea of using our robot defensively. Our ability to maintain our rotation
						whilst driving left to right played a big role in our matches, and eventually our victory.

						<em>"Just Survive!"</em> is a collaborative pet-project I've been working on with a group of friends, including 
						<a href="https://eli-wood-dev.github.io">Eli Wood</a>.
						Made in the Unity engine, it is a single player, wave and economy based, first person zombie shooter, with
						tower defense elements.
						One of the first hurdles we encountered with this project was to figure out how to work on the
						game collaboratively at the same time. We eventually were able to get a common workflow in place,
						utilizing GitHub to host our main codebase, with 3D models and assets being shared to the developers
						(such as myself) via online cloud file-hosting software. The game is still in it's early stages, but I look
						forward to sharing it here and on my itch.io when it is complete!

						<em>"Roads of Rage"</em> is an unfinished game that was being developed in Greenfoot for a class project. The project
						was not just about making games however, which is why I am including it here despite being incomplete. The purpose
						of the project was to gain hands on experience with agile methodologies in the development cycle. The class was broken
						into smaller teams which each had to devote roles to the team members and coordinate between each other using Slack and
						other collaborative technologies to design and develop a game from scratch. Unfortunately, due to time constraints at the
						end of the semester we were unable to complete the game itself, but regardless the project taught me a lot of valuable skills.
