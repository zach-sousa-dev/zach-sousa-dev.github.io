						<em>"Just Survive!"</em> is a collaborative pet-project I've been working on with a group of friends.
						Made in the Unity engine, it is a single player, wave and economy based, first person zombie shooter.
						One of the first hurdles we encountered with this project was to figure out how to work on the
						game collaboratively at the same time. We eventually were able to get a common workflow in place,
						utilizing GitHub to host our main codebase, with 3D models and assets being shared to the developers
						(such as myself) via online cloud hosting software. The game is still in it's early stages, but I look
						forward to sharing it here and on my itch.io when it is complete!
